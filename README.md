# City Route Planner (Graph-based Project in C)

This project simulates a City Route Planner using Graph Data Structures in C.

## Features
- Add or delete cities and roads  
- Display adjacency list and adjacency matrix  
- Find shortest paths using Breadth First Search (BFS) and Dijkstra's Algorithm  
- Display route summary (total distance, average distance per leg)  
- Automatically save and load data from file  

## Concepts Used
- Graphs (Adjacency List)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
- File Handling
- Structured Programming in C

## Compilation
Use the following command to compile all files:

```bash
gcc main.c graph.c algorithms.c -o city_route
